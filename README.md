# Snake-single-game
Choose the game parameters and play a single round of Snake

## How do you play
Before the game starts, you are asked to set the board size, game speed and food amount.

The snake is controlled by arrows. If you crash into a wall or the snake's tail, the game is over. If you collect the amount of food that you set before game, you win. There is an infinite food option: you have to collect as much food as you can before crash.

- Designing a game with a few input parameters
- Graphical interface with Turtle Graphics
